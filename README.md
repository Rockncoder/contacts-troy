This is app we built for the Angular 2 weekend workshop. 

For more tutorials like this be sure to follow [@therockncoder](https://twitter.com/therockncoder).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.32.3.

## JavaScript Training

I am working with the good folks at [PeopleSpace](http://peoplespace.us/javascript/) in Irvine, CA. Join us at one of our affordable weekend workshops.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).



## Firebase

There is one missing file, src/app/FirebaseConfig.ts. It contains all of your firebase configuration information.

```
export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  authDomain: "xxxxxxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://xxxxxxxxxxx.firebaseio.com",
  storageBucket: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "xxxxxxxxxxx"
};
```
